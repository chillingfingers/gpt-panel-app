# Text Generator Web App

This branch follows up on my guide on building a text generation web app with OpenGPT-2 and St. The guide can be found [here](https://medium.com/@devkosal/build-a-text-generator-web-app-in-under-50-lines-of-python-9b63d47edabb). Instead of Panel, we try Streamlit. Streamlit can not be used out of Jupyter so we have to run ```streamlit run basic.py``` in order to run our server.

## Requirements
- Python => 3.7
- numpy =>  1.17.3 
- torch => 1.3.0 
- transformers => 2.1.1 
- streamlit => 0.49.0
